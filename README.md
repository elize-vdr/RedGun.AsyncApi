# Introduction
The AsyncAPI.NET SDK contains a useful object model for AsyncAPI documents in .NET along with common serializers to extract raw AsyncAPI JSON and YAML documents from the model.

This is the start of the conversion of the OpenApi.Net code base to AsyncAPI.Net, see [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/en). Because there is not yet an AsyncAPI library and because it is close to the OpenAPI protocol it seemed the logical step would be to clone the OpenAPI.Net and adapt it to AsyncAPI for .Net.

# Progress
Most of the code has been converted, the unit tests still needs to be converted and everything tested.
In Progress . . .
